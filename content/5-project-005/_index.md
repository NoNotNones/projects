#### Overviews

In this project, we will discuss how to connect an On-premise data center to Amazon VPC using a hard or soft VPN, depending on the specific requirements. To establish a Site-to-Site VPN connection, the following steps need to be taken:

## 1. Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) and Customer Gateway (CGW) Setup

- **Virtual Private Gateway (VPG)**: This serves as the control center that connects the virtual private network (VPN) within AWS.

- **Customer Gateway (CGW)**: This component represents the hard or soft VPN device located at the Client's end.
