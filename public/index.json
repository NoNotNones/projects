It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that Security Groups operate at the Instance layer and not at the Subnet layer.\nNote: Security Groups function at the virtual machine level, rather than the subnet level. However, each virtual machine within a subnet can be assigned to different security groups.\nContents Notes "

To establish a Site-to-Site VPN connection, the following steps need to be taken:\n1. Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) and Customer Gateway (CGW) Setup Virtual Private Gateway (VPG): This serves as the control center that connects the virtual private network (VPN) within AWS.\nCustomer Gateway (CGW): This component represents the hard or soft VPN device located at the Client\u0026rsquo;s end.\nContents Notes "
